# shiny_solar_production
Shiny app will create a table showing optimal azimuth and tilt for maximum solar production for fixed solar arrays.  
Calculations for solar position are created using the R `suncalc` libarary created by Benoit Thieurmel [aut, cre] (R interface), Achraf Elmarhraoui [aut] (R interface). <https://github.com/datastorm-open/suncalc>  

The table presents the percentage of solar power available calculated for each azimuth and tilt for any latitude and longitude.   The Y axis shows the Tilt angle and the X axis shows the perpendicular Azimuth in True North degrees to orient a fixed solar panel to capture the maximum solar power. 

This shiny app code is available on my GitHub repository <https://github.com/rccline/shiny_solar_production*>  
The live shiny app is available at <*https://landman.shinyapps.io/SolarProduction/*>
